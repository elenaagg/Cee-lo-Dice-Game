# Cee-lo-Dice-Game

The "Cee-lo" is a traditional dice game that has roots in various cultures, including Chinese culture. The game is often associated with gambling, though it can also be played for fun. Here's a general idea of how it works:

# 🎲 Game Rules 

## 👥 Players
- 2 to 6 players.
- Each starts with 5–100 coins.
- One randomly chosen player becomes the **banker**.

## 💰 Betting
- Banker sets a **bank amount** (1 to their total coins).
- Other players place **bets**, total not exceeding the bank amount.

## 🎲 Dice Rolls
Each round involves rolling **3 dice**. Results are interpreted as:

### ✅ Automatic Wins
- Three of a kind (e.g., `4-4-4`)
- Sequence `4-5-6`
- Pair + 6 (e.g., `3-3-6`)

### ❌ Automatic Losses
- Sequence `1-2-3`
- Pair + 1 (e.g., `5-5-1`)

### ⚖️ Scored Rolls
- Two of a kind + one different → score = the odd die
  - Example: `2-2-5` → Score: 5
  - Players compare against banker’s score

## 🔁 Round Outcome
- Banker rolls first.
- If banker wins/loses automatically, round ends.
- Otherwise, each player rolls:
  - Higher score than banker → player wins bet
  - Lower score → banker wins
  - Same score → tie

## 🏦 Banker Rotation
- If banker auto-loses, a **new banker is chosen**.
- If **2 players win**, banker is also changed.

## 🏁 End of Game
- Game ends when any player (including banker) runs out of coins.
- The bankrupt player is announced.
